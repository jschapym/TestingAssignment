# Week 3 Assignment: Testing Go for Statistics (Winter 2024)

In the main.go file, Linear Regressions are run on each data set in the Anscombe Quartet, and Linear Regression Coefficients are documented.

In the main_test.go file, these Linear Regression functions are put to test comparing the expected results to the results obtained from the functions.

Overall, when the tests failed, they were off by 0.0001-0.0003.

Recommendations

Go is rather easy to learn and provides a simple, clear, clean, and organized. Replacing current programming languages would provide a faster, more efficient coding mechanism for the company. 

Benefits:

-Ease of Use.
-A large number of sources can be instrumented.
-Fast Performance.
-Simple to Learn.

The only problem with introducing Go and the new programming language would be the learning curve. Although fairly simple to learn, it would take some workshops for employees to familiarize themselves with it.

Limitations (potential):

-Learning Curve.
-Must get packages from outside sources, whereas in Python or Go, the packages are held within.
-Other languages may be better when it comes to data visualization.

Overall, with enough training and support from management, the team should be able to easily switch over to Go.
